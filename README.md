# Project `Test.RealEsta`

This project has been developed using cutting-edge technologies to ensure efficient performance, maintainability, and scalability. Below are the key technologies and patterns used in the creation of this project:

## Technologies Used
- **.NET 8 and .NET Core:** The project is built on the latest versions of the .NET platform, leveraging features and improvements introduced in .NET 8 and .NET Core to ensure modern and efficient development.

## Architecture Patterns
- **Clean Architecture:** The project's architecture adheres to the principles of Clean Architecture, clearly separating the application, domain, and infrastructure layers to achieve a clean and modular design.

## Design Patterns
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** The CQRS pattern has been adopted to separate read and write operations, facilitating scalability and improving performance by allowing independent optimization of each type of operation.

- **MEDIATOR:** Implementing a Mediator facilitates communication between system components, reducing direct dependencies and promoting lower coupling.

## Security
- **Identity JWT (JSON Web Token):** Identity JWT is used for authentication and authorization, providing a modern standard for securely transmitting information between parties, ensuring data integrity and authenticity.

## Unit Testing
- **NUnit:** Unit tests have been developed using NUnit, a unit testing framework for .NET that simplifies test creation and execution, ensuring code quality and facilitating future updates and modifications.

This project has been created with a focus on best practices in software development, leveraging the latest technologies and robust design patterns to ensure efficient, maintainable, and robust code. Feel free to explore and contribute to the development of this project. Thank you for your interest!
